Dropbox has a Standard price of 12 euros per month, offers storage of 5 TB, and three users or more can have access to the service.
On the other hand, Google offers Cloud Storage adding facilities with stream videos, images, web libraries, and data lakes. This service includes a pack called Standard Storage the benefit of it, is that the enterprise can increase or reduce according to its needs.
This cloud service could help the enterprise to increase the followers with publicity, having this service the company can hire journalists from bigger cities or other States with the option of competing against other social media resources.
The second recommendation is getting a Payment Service Provider, PSP, with this service the enterprise could facilitate the transactions with its customers.
